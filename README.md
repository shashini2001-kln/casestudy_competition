# 🌧️ Rainfall Trend Analysis & Spatial-Temporal Study in Sri Lanka (1979–2023)

## 📌 Overview

This project was conducted for the **Case Study Poster Competition** at the **International Statistics Conference 2024 (ISC 2024)** organized by the **Institute of Applied Statistics, Sri Lanka (IASSL)** in collaboration with the **International Water Management Institute (IWMI)**.

The main objective is to derive **key rainfall indices**, conduct **spatial and temporal trend analysis**, and generate **innovative visualizations** using remote sensing rainfall data over Sri Lanka from **1979 to 2023**.

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data Source:** Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) product
- **Analysis Techniques:**
  - Trend analysis using **Mann-Kendall** and **Sen’s slope** (as per Lacombe et al.)
  - **Seasonality detection** and rainfall concentration indices (as per Seldmeier et al.)
  - Time series decomposition & exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA)
- **Software Used:** R (packages: `raster`, `rgdal`, `tidyverse`, `Kendall`, `ggplot2`, `trend`, `lubridate`, `sf`, `terra`)

## 🖼️ Visualizations

The project features:
- Temporal trend plots for major rainfall stations
- Interactive maps showing regional changes
- Heatmaps and rainfall intensity graphics
- Seasonal pattern decomposition

## 🎯 Key Outcomes

- Identified **declining rainfall trends** in dry zone areas
- Delays in **monsoonal onset** and shifts in peak rainfall months
- Spatial disparities in rainfall intensity and distribution
- Data-driven guidance for **climate-resilient water planning**
